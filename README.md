### Numerical Analysis Repository (MATLAB):

Welcome To Numerical-Analysis Repository!
This repository implements  different numerical analysis methods, including algorithms for solving equations, optimization problems, integration, and differential equations.
This repository is aimed at helping Engineers and Mathematicians with different examples of small projects devising numerical analysis theoretical concepts to solve real-life engineering problems.
The code is written in [Matlab] and designed to have detailed comments that are efficient and easy to understand, with examples and documentation to guide users.
