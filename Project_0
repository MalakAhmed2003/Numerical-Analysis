%% Question1: Vectors
%{  (a) How can you generate a vector of even integers ranging from 6 to 32, inclusive, without manually typing the values? Show the code to achieve this.

(b) If you need to create a vector containing 11 numbers that are evenly spaced between 0.95 and 3.3, what MATLAB function would you use? Demonstrate how to apply this function.

(c) Consider two vectors, A = [2.3 3.3 4.3 5.3 6.3 7.3] and B = [1 2 0 5 6]. What is the result and reasoning for each of the following expressions?

i. A(B(1))

ii. A(B(2))

iii. A(logical(B))

iv. A(4:end)

v. A([2 3 4])

vi. A([1:3, 6])

vii. How can you create a new vector C that includes all elements of A, except for the 3rd one? Use indexing to construct C.
}%

% Part a
vec1 = [6:2:32]

% Part b
%creating a vector of evenly spaced values using linspace() function
vec2 = linspace(.95, 3.3, 11)
A=[2.3 3.3 4.3 5.3 6.3 7.3], B=[1 2 0 5 6];

% Part c1
%B(1) returns the first element of the array B, which is 1 and then A(1) returns the first
%element of the array A, which is 2.3
A(B(1))

% Part c2
%B(2) returns the first element of the array B, which is 2 and then A(2) returns the first
%element of the array A, which is 3.3
A(B(2))


% Part c3
A(logical(B))


% Part c4
% 4:end returns the indicies from the fourth element in A till the end of
% array, which is the sixth element
A(4:end)

% Part c5
% Returns the elements of undicies 2, 3 aand 4 from the array A
A([2 3 4])

% Part c6
% Returns the elements of undicies starting at the first element till the third
% and skips the fourth and fifth and then returns the sixth as well.
A([1:3, 6])

% Part c7
C = A([1:2, 4:6])


%% Question2: Matrices
%{
 (a) How would you write the code to create a matrix with 3 columns and 12 rows, where all the elements are set to 1?
(b) Write a simple piece of code that reshapes the vector A = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] into the matrix A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9].
(c) Given the vectors A = [1 2 3] and B = [4 5 6], what is the result and why when you perform the operation A * B'?
(d) For the vectors A = [1 2 3] and B = [4 5 6], what is the result and why when you perform the operation A' * B?
(e) What happens when you perform A * B with the vectors A = [1 2 3] and B = [4 5 6]? Explain why.
(f) Given a large matrix A = rand(36, 54), how can you use indexing (without loops) to create a new matrix B that includes all the columns of A but omits the 12th row?
}%

% Part a
mat1 = ones(12, 3)

% Part b
D = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9];
D = reshape(D, 3, 3);
D = D'

% Part c
E=[1 2 3], F=[4 5 6]; 
E * F' % This applies matrix multiplication between the matrix E and F-transpose (1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6)= 32


% Part d
 E' * F 

% Part e
 
%A*B % this gives an error because it requires a matrix multiplication
% between two matrices of in consistent sizes, E of 1*3, and F of 1*3

% Part f
G = rand(36,54)
H = G([1:11, 13:end], :)

%% Question3: Loops and IF statements
%{
 (a) Write a code snippet that creates a FOR loop where the index variable i starts at 4 and increases by 3 with each iteration. The loop should run for a total of 5 iterations before stopping.
(b) Write a code snippet that creates a WHILE loop where the index variable i starts at 9 and decreases by 2 with each iteration. The loop should run for 4 iterations before terminating.
(c) Write an IF-ELSE statement that checks if a variable i is equal to 3. If true, it should set x = 5. If i is not equal to 3, the statement should check if i is greater than 7. If that condition is true, it should set x = 7. If neither condition is true, set x = 0.
}%

% Part a
for i = 4:3: 18
    disp('Hi')
end

% Part b
j = 9;
while j > 1
    disp('Hello')
    j = j-2;
end

% Part c
if i == 3
    x = 5
else
    if i > 7
        x = 7
    else 
        x = 0
    end
end

%% Question4: Functions and Scripts
%{
(a) Develop a brief script that displays the numbers 1 to 5 in the console when run.
(b) Write a function that, given two integer arguments a and b, prints all the integers starting from a up to b in the console.
}%

% Part a
for s = 1: 1:5
    %disp(s)
end
% Part b
function PrintIntegers(a, b)
    for c = a: 1: b
        disp(c)
    end
end
PrintIntegers(1, 5)

%% Question5: Plotting
%{
(a) Create a plot that shows the cosine of x over the interval from 0 to 2π2\pi2π.
(b) Write a code snippet that produces a graph with two y-axes: one displaying sin(x) on the left and the other displaying cos(x) on the right, with x ranging from 0 to 2π2\pi2π.
}%

% Part a
z = 0:pi/200:2*pi;
y1 = cos(z);
plot(z,y1)
ylabel('cos(z)')
xlabel('z')


% Part b
y1 = cos(z);
y2 = sin(z);
yyaxis left;
plot(z,y2)
ylabel('sin(z)')
xlabel('z')

hold on;
yyaxis right;
plot(z,y1)
ylabel('cos(z)')
